            <p class="description">
              Dive with me into the details of my new computer set, which I put
              together for PLN 6,000. In this video I'll show you how I selected
              components that offer optimal performance and quality for gaming
              and creative work. Let's take a closer look at what makes this
              piece of equipment not only powerful, but also aesthetically
              perfect. Follow me through the process of building, testing and
              evaluating how it performs in the latest gaming titles and
              everyday tasks. Find out if investing in high-quality components
              actually improves the user experience and if it's a set you would
              want to have yourself.
