            <p>
              I offer a wide range of services related to application
              development and web design. My portfolio includes web and mobile
              application designs, as well as graphic designs and user
              interfaces. Additionally, there is a blog on my website where I
              share my life, passions and experience related to studies.

            <img src="src/assets/img/Faq2.webp" />
            <p>
              The cooperation process begins with the first contact, followed by
              the signing of the contract. Then we define the scope of work and
              conduct a conversation to agree on the details of the project.
              Thanks to this, the process is transparent and tailored to the
              individual needs of the client.

          <div>
            <img src="src/assets/img/Faq3.webp" />
            <p>
              I specialize in creating applications using technologies such as
              React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, PHP, Laravel, as well as in working
              with MySQL (Oracle) databases and the GitHub code management tool.

          <div>
            <img src="src/assets/img/Faq4.webp" />
            <p>
              Prices for my services are determined individually, depending on
              the scope and complexity of the project. I always strive to ensure
              that my services are competitive and tailored to the client's
              budget.

          <div>
            <img src="src/assets/img/Faq5.webp" />
            <p>
              The project implementation time depends on its scope and
              requirements. Each project is different, so the completion date is
              agreed individually with the client.

          <div>
            <img src="src/assets/img/Faq6.webp" />
            <p>
              Yes, I offer a guarantee of a well-executed project and support
              after its completion. I make sure that my clients are fully
              satisfied with the final product.

          <div>
            <img src="src/assets/img/Faq7.webp" />
            <p>
              My design philosophy is based on creating solutions that not only
              look aesthetic, but are, above all, functional and tailored to the
              needs of users. I believe that good design combines clarity,
              usability and innovation.

            <p>
              What information do you need from the client to get started? To
              get started, I need an initial design brief from the client that
              includes the project goal, target audience, style and
              functionality preferences, as well as any other information that
              may be relevant to the project.

              What are your favorite projects in your portfolio and why? My
              favorite projects are those that challenged me and allowed me to
              develop new skills. I value projects in which I could experiment
              with new technologies and solutions, which brought satisfaction to
              both me and my clients.

              What hobbies or interests do you have outside of design and
              programming? My passions outside the IT world are acting on the
              Internet. When I was a kid, I ran a YouTube channel, recording
              games on it. I am active on Instagram and Tiktok. I have many
              interests.
